chessboard with vanilla js, you can make moves and stuff and it uses fontawesome icons so it's animated. It's also responsive. 

There is no move validation or anything and there's some pretty big bugs when you make moves, especially when you drag your mouse while clicking. No clue what's wrong but I gave up
